# Chapter 2 - exercise

## 1. SK model

Here, we set the number of spins $N=15$, and the strength of connection $J_0 = 0$, $J=1$. We vary the $\beta$ form 0.1 to 5 and implement both cavity and enumeration methods to derive free energy. 



## 2. Sourlas Code

Here, we set the number of information bits $N=50$ and follow the problem settings to set the other parameters, i.e. $M=100$ï¼Œ$K=3$. By varying the flipping probability from 0.01 to 0.4, we obtain the recover accuracy, which have sharply decrease around $p=0.1. It means the system has first-order phase transition.
